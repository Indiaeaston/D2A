# Senior Capstone Project by Morgan Lee, India Easton, Brooklynn Fergerson, and Sky Brumfield.

The primary objective of our website is to facilitate seamless, real-time communication between English-speaking healthcare providers and Spanish-speaking patients. By enabling live spoken translation from English to Spanish (and vice versa), we aim to eliminate the need for a third-party interpreter, thus fostering a more direct, personal interaction. This approach is precious in medical environments, where clear communication can improve patient outcomes, comfort, and overall experience.

Our primary users will be:
- Spanish-speaking patients who may have limited proficiency in English.
- Healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, administrative staff) who require a reliable tool for immediate translation without needing fluency in Spanish.
- Medical office staff responsible for patient intake, scheduling, and general communication tasks.
- This website will also benefit the larger healthcare community by supporting clinics and hospitals that may not have immediate access to in-person interpreters, such as rural medical offices or high-volume urban clinics.

## Key Features and Accessibility:
- Live Speech-to-Text Translation
- Functionality: This feature will transcribe spoken English and Spanish into text in real-time, then translate it into the other language. The translation will display in a text box for both parties to read, minimizing misunderstandings and ensuring clarity.
- Accessibility Benefit: According to research on language accessibility in healthcare, real-time translation tools can significantly reduce miscommunications in critical areas like patient symptoms, treatment plans, and medication instructions (Flores, 2021). By providing clear text readouts, this feature assists

Functionality of User-Friendly Interface with Simplified Navigation: A straightforward layout with large icons, minimal text, and easy navigation buttons enables quick access to translation functions. Users can initiate a conversation, pause, or switch language modes easily without complex menus.
Accessibility Benefit of UI: Literature suggests that streamlined, intuitive interfaces are particularly beneficial in high-stress environments like healthcare (Harvey, 2019). For example, a medical assistant could quickly initiate a session without technical assistance, thereby supporting a smoother workflow.

Functionality of Voice Clarity and Background Noise Management: The website will incorporate automatic filtering for background noise, enhancing voice clarity during live translations. Advanced algorithms will help reduce errors by focusing on the primary speaker.
Accessibility Benefit of Voice Clarity: In noisy medical settings, such as clinics with crowded waiting rooms, noise filtering is essential. According to recent studies, individuals in stressful or high-stimulus environments benefit from this kind of feature, which reduces cognitive load and minimizes the risk of misunderstandings (Wang et al., 2020).
