Instructions to set up the server for my lovely India

Set Up:
1. $ clone git repository (It might give you less trouble if you clone it)
2. $ npm install
2. Go to Service Account on Google Cloud Platform and Create an API Key
	a. Go to IAM Admin
	b. Go to Keys
	c. Add Key (make sure it's under My First Project) and download the JSON file
3. Create an Environment Variable for API Key
	a. Open your MAC terminal or do it in VS Code terminal **If its giving you trouble, add the environment variable in your settings.json file in VS Code**
	b. $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="filepath/to/your_API_Key)
	c. Double check that the Env variable was created; create a test.js file and copy in console.log(process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS); then in your terminal $ node test.js ;If it returns the correct filepath to your APIkey.JSON file, then you're good.
4. In node.js, change the filepath of the audio to wherever the audio is stored on the computer. Or download a new audio and test it. Just make sure to update the filepath and use double slashes if you're getting trouble. Ex) "homeDir\\myMP3File.mp3"
5. You are all set up! Run from project terminal: $ npm start
6. If it runs correctly, you should see the Speech-to-Text in your terminal. View the backend site on http:\\localhost:3000
