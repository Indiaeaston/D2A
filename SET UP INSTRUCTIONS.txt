Instructions to set up the server for my lovely India
Start from an empty folder in your VS terminal
1. $ clone git repository //Beep bop just clone it, TRUST
2. $ npm install //Yayyyyy you have all the packages now!! Easy peezy lemon squeezy!! 
2. Go to Service Account on Google Cloud Platform and Create an API Key //You should have all permissions to "My First Project" with indiaeaston29@gmail.com
	a. Go to IAM Admin
	b. Go to Keys
	c. Add Key (make sure it's under My First Project) and download the JSON file
3. Create an Environment Variable for API Key
	a. Open your MAC terminal
	b. $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="filepath/to/your_API_Key"
	c. To double check that the Env variable was created, you can create a test.js file and copy in: console.log(process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS) . Then from your terminal run: $ node test.js ; If it outputs the correct file path to your apiKey.JSON file, then you're golden.
4. In node.js, change the audio file path to wherever the audio is stored on the computer. Or download a new audio and to test. I picked an audio from the Office but it can be anything you want. Just make sure to update that file path!! And for whatever weird reason, use double slashes XD
5. Omg, woohoooo you did it!! You're all set up! From your project terminal you can now run: $ npm start
6. If you ran it and just got an error, yikes. Gemini is your bestie. But don't worry, she helped me through tough times too!!
6. If it DID run correctly, WOOOHOOO!! Hopefully you can see the Speech-to-Text in your terminal and view the backend site on http:\\localhost:3000
