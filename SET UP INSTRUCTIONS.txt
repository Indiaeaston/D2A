Instructions to set up the server for my lovely India

1. $ clone git repository (It might give you less trouble if you clone it)
2. $ npm install
2. Go to Service Account on Google Cloud Platform and Create an API Key
	a. Go to IAM Admin
	b. Go to Keys
	c. Add Key (make sure it's under My First Project) and download the JSON file
3. Create an Environment Variable for API Key
	a. Open your MAC terminal or do it in VS Code terminal **If its giving you trouble, add the environment variable in your settings.json file in VS Code**
	b. $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="filepath/to/your_API_Key)
	c. Double check that the Env variable was created; create a test.js file and copy in: console.log(process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS); then from your terminal run: $ node test.js ;If it returns the correct file path to your apiKey.JSON file, then you're good.
4. In node.js, change the audio file path to wherever the audio is stored on the computer. Or download a new audio and to test. Just make sure to update that file path and use double slashes. Ex) "homeDir\\myMP3File.mp3"
5. Woohoo, Congratulations! You are all set up! From your project terminal run: $ npm start
6. If you ran it and just got an error, welp. Gemini is your bestie.
